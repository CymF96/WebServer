I see, thanks for clarifying. After a thorough review of your logs and configuration, I've identified the core issue:

The Problem
Your server is setting the CGI flag to true for this request:

When it sees a path containing "cgi" (even as /fcgi), it's treating it as a CGI request rather than a static HTML file. This is likely due to how your server handles URL paths that contain "cgi".

Root Causes
CGI Processing Override:

Your server appears to have logic that automatically sets cgi_flag to true for any URL containing "cgi"
This happens regardless of your configuration
Error in Path Resolution:

After setting the CGI flag, your server can't find the actual CGI executable
It then returns a 404 error
Solutions
Create a Non-CGI Name: Try a location name that doesn't contain "cgi" at all:

Then access: http://localhost:8080/htmlpage/

Fix the CGI Handler in Your Code:

Locate where your server sets the CGI flag based on URL
Modify it to only set CGI flag for the exact /cgi-bin/ path or when cgi: on is explicitly set
Create Test HTML Outside /cgi:

Then try accessing: http://localhost:8080/test.html

Add Debug Output:

Add a simple text file in the same directory:
Try accessing: http://localhost:8080/cgi/test.txt
The core issue is in your server's request handling logic, not your configuration. Your server appears to have special handling for any URL containing "cgi" that's overriding your configuration.
