## ⚙️ Configuration

### Basic Configuration Example

```nginx
# config/server.conf
server {
    listen 8080;
    server_name localhost;
    root ./www;
    index index.html index.htm;
    
    error_page 404 /error/404.html;
    error_page 500 /error/500.html;
    
    client_max_body_size 1M;
    
    location / {
        allow_methods GET POST DELETE;
        autoindex on;
    }
    
    location /cgi-bin/ {
        allow_methods GET POST;
        cgi_extension .py .php .pl;
        cgi_path /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/php /usr/bin/perl;
    }
    
    location /upload/ {
        allow_methods POST;
        upload_path ./uploads/;
    }
}
```

### Virtual Host Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 8080;
    server_name site1.local;
    root ./www/site1;
    index index.html;
}

server {
    listen 8080;
    server_name site2.local;
    root ./www/site2;
    index index.php;
    
    location *.php {
        cgi_extension .php;
        cgi_path /usr/bin/php;
    }
}
```

## 🔧 HTTP Methods Supported

| `POST` | ✅ Complete | Submit data, file uploads |
| `DELETE` | ✅ Complete | Delete resources |
| `HEAD` | 🔄 In Progress | Get headers only |
| `PUT` | ❌ Planned | Upload/update resources |

## 🧪 Testing

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :8080
# Kill the process or change port in config
```

**Permission denied:**
```bash
# Make sure you have permissions for the port
sudo ./webserver  # For ports < 1024
```

**CGI scripts not executing:**
```bash
# Check script permissions
chmod +x www/cgi-bin/script.py
# Verify interpreter path in config
```

**High memory usage:**
```bash
# Run with Valgrind to check for leaks
valgrind --leak-check=full ./webserver
```
